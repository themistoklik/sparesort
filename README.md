# Sparesort

**Sparesort** is a Java library for performing sequential pattern mining, which is a data mining problem for analyzing sequencing or time related processes, e.g. customer purchase or web access patterns. 
This library implements BIDE, an efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed sequences. This is my own fork with tuned I/O for the needs of my thesis.

## System Requirements

* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.5 or higher

## Usage

### From console

The distribution contains an executable JAR (`sparesort-X.Y.Z.jar`).

    java -jar sparesort-X.Y.Z.jar <directory_holding_sequence_files> minsup

After mining is finished, all frequent closed sequences qualified by the threshold and their frequency are written in a file to avoid spamming the stdout (for large tasks it's cumbersome).

### Within your code

1. Create an instance of `jp.ac.titech.cs.se.sparesort.SequenceDatabase<T>` which supports `addSequence(List<T>)` and `addSequence(T...)` methods to load item sequences.

		// Create and load seqauence database
		SequenceDatabase<String> sdb = new SequenceDatabase<String>()
			.addSequence("C", "A", "A", "B", "C")
			.addSequence("A", "B", "C", "B")
			.addSequence("C", "A", "B", "C")
			.addSequence("A", "B", "B", "C", "A");

2. (Optional) Set an alternative mining strategy. When no strategy is given, `jp.ac.titech.cs.se.sparesort.bide.RecursiveBIDE<T>` is used as a default strategy to perform depth-first mining based on recursive calls.

		sdb.setMiningStrategy(new RecursiveBIDE<String>());

3. Execute `mineFrequentClosedSequences(int)` method giving an absolute minimum support threshold as its argument.
The return value is a mapping from frequent sequences found in the sequence database and their frequency.

		Map<List<String>, Integer> result = sdb.mineFrequentClosedSequences(2);

## Compile and build

Sparesort is built by using [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).
Before you proceed, download Maven and configure the environment variable `M2_HOME` properly.

1. Fork (or download) the source code.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt, move to the directory containing pom.xml and hit `mvn package` there.
3. After maven build succeeds, you will find `sparesort-X.Y.Z.jar` in `target/` subdirectory.
